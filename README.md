# SICS
Experiment codes for "Selecting Distinctive-Variant Training Samples Base on Intra-class Similarity"\
In this repo, we upload our source code of the paper <Selecting Distinctive-Variant Training Samples Base on Intra-class Similarity>, which is called SICS as method.
  The code for mnist,cifar10, and cifar100 contain two .py file, the 'split-mnist.py' , 'split_cifar10.py' and the 'split_cifar100.py' is for  selecting the distinctive-variant samples, 
  and the 'pruned_mnist.py', 'pruned_cifar10.py' and the 'pruned_cifar100.py' is used to gain the test accuracy.
  We designed the random files and the forgetting score files as the comparasion. Those also committed in this repo.
